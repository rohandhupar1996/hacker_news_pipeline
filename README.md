we will use the pipeline we have been building, and apply it to a real world data pipeline project. From a JSON API, we will filter, clean, aggregate, and summarize data in a sequence of tasks that will apply these transformations for us.  The data we will use comes from a Hacker News (HN) API that returns JSON data of the top stories in 2014. If you're unfamiliar with Hacker News, it's a link aggregator website that users vote up stories that are interesting to the community. It is similar to Reddit, but the community only revolves around on computer science and entrepreneurship posts.
